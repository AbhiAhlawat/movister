# Tech Stack Selection 

In spite of all the smart devices that exist today in the world, one thing that is common is - web and internet browsers. I selected my application to be a <b>web application</b> so that a large number of users are able to explore different types of Movies and TV shows and get recommendations for the same. 

For frontend development, I have used <b> React JS </b>. For backend development, I have used <b>NodeJS and TMDb API</b>.

# Usage of Agile Methodology 

After exploring various software development techniques, I understood how a modern software is developed and how agile methodologies are very good for that, this is when I understood the importance of incorporating Agile Methodology into my project. 

As this wasn't a team project, I could not assign different tasks to different people and form a sprint out of it. Therefore I divided myself into five different people - one who will research, one who will design, one who will develop the frontend of the web application, one who will develop the backend of the web application and finally the one who will fix bugs. This division helped me to get into a zone and focus on a particular functionality whenever I was working on the project. 

This disciplined process upon MS-MOVREC development gave me the following benefits: 
- It made my development process predicatable and more efficient. 
- It made my development process easy to handle, flexible and allowed more room to adjust new functionalities. 

<br>
I divided my entire development process into <b>4 sprints (each having the duration of 1 week).</b> I gave due importance to the bug review and fixing part of the development process as it is crucial to offer whatever features you are offering are offered with utmost perfection.

# Challenges Faced

"If you are not facing challenges while developing an application, you are not considering every possible case for a better experience of your users."

During the development process I faced the following challenges: 
1. Understanding the working of the backend side of my application as I had never worked with web backend before. However, thanks to online communities, stackoverflow, my mentors and friends I was able to find resources which helped me in creating this web application. 
2. Preparing a feature list. In the beginning I wanted to build an app like no other and incorporate many features. But in the interest of time, I had to narrow down the features to the basic functionalities that are available in a Recommendation web application. 
3. Hosting. Initially I was using Firebase to host my application and I realised it later after reading articles online that Firebase will not be able to handle the server code I had written. Therefore I switched to Vercel. The deployment was easy and I did learn a valuable lesson that even if it is the tiniest part of your application, you need to research well and make sure the service you are choosing caters to all the needs of your software.

All these challenges were less of challenges and more of lessons, lessons to help me have an even better development process in the future so that I can incorporate the customers' requests and requirements easily and efficiently.

# Future Scope
The web application can be improved by adding the following features. 
1. Adding responsiveness and making it compatible with devices having smaller screens. 
2. Adding Authentication.
3. Adding User Profiles having the likes and dislikes of the person.
4. Adding the recommendations based on the language.
5. Adding the recommendations based on the genres by giving the user to choose the genres from a given list of genres and getting the top rated movies of that specific genre.
6. Adding Watchlater and History Manager on the basis of which the recommendations can be further modified.
